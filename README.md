# SDL2_C++_Game_Project_Food_Tornado

A non-commercial game project using SDL2 and C++

## Description

This is an open-source game project using C++ and SDL2 (including SDL2_image and SDL2_mixer). The game is not fully completed and tested. If you encounter bugs or have pull requests, feel free to contact the author.

## Setting

You are a friend of a bear in the wood. One day, there is a strange tornado sweeps through - a food tornado! Everyone is going out of their houses to catch as much (free) food as possible. However, your bear friend is too lazy to get out of the cozy bed and asks you to go instead. Let's help your friend get as much food as possible ( ‚Ä¢ÃÄ œâ ‚Ä¢ÃÅ )‚úß

## Rules

Use two arrow keys ‚¨Ö and ‚û° to move the basket to catch as much food as possible. Be careful since the food will drop faster over time. You can pause the game if you need to take a break.

You will have 3 "lives" at the beginning of the game. Each time you miss a portion of food, the bear will get angry and take away one of your "lives". The game will end when you run out of "lives" so watch out!
